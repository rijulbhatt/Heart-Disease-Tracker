# Heart-Disease-Tracker

Heart disease is a major cause of death globally, so early detection is essential. This project uses logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest classifiers to analyze health data and risk factors. By studying these factors, we aim to create a model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease. This tool will help healthcare professionals identify and treat heart disease early.
